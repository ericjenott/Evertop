  An e-ink portable PC that emulates an IBM XT with an 80186 processor and 1MB RAM. Can run DOS, Minix, and some other old 1980s operating systems. Also Windows versions up to 3.0.
Features built in keyboard, external PS/2 keyboard and mouse ports, full CGA, Hercules, and MCGA graphics support, partial EGA and VGA support, PC speaker, Adlib, Covox, and Disney Sound Source sound output, built in speaker and headphone jack, one DB9 RS232 serial port, one TTL serial port, USB flash drive port for convenient file transfer, wired ethernet, wifi, and LoRA radio (I wrote a LoRA realtime chat client in QBasic in about 15 minutes). Bluetooth hardware is present but have not yet implemented any features that use it, though I plan to add support for BT keyboard and mouse, and maybe serial over BT, IP over BT, and BT file transfer. Keyboard can be easily separated to make it convenient to prop up the device at an angle while placing the keyboard on a flat surface. Or you can just plug in you own, as sometimes it's nice to be able to use a full sized keyboard, though the one I built into this device is big enough for normal typing.

Three-way charging: 1.) built in detachable solar panel, 2.) 2.5 - 20V DC input, or 3.) USB micro connector. Can charge from all three sources simultaneously, and of course charge in every way while in use. Includes a built in voltmeter for ease of monitoring battery level and charging voltage.

In power saving mode can run between 200 hours on the low side and 500 hours or even much longer on the high side of constant interactive usage, NOT standby. I'm working on porting a simple native (non-emulated) text editor / word processor and e-reader that I made several years ago for a similar pocket device prototype. I'm hoping I can get over 1000 hours of constant use on a single charge with those. Also supports user initiated and automatic hibernate to disk and automatic total power shutoff via an IO controlled dual MOSFET circuit, so you can set it to hibernate and completely shut off power when idle. Internal peripherals can be shut off when not in use via physical switches on the front panel to ensure no power is being wasted. Supports up to 256G SD card to store floppy and hard disk images, up to 4G per disk image. Emulated systems can mount two floppies and two hard drives for a total of 8G per emulated system.

Runs almost all IBM PC/XT/DOS software from the 1980s and early 90s.
